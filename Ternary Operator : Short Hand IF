In C++, you can write `if` statements in shorthand using the **ternary operator** `? :`, which is great for simple conditional assignments or outputs.

### 📌 Syntax:
```cpp
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
```

### ✅ Example:
```cpp
int a = 10, b = 20;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
cout << "Max: " << max << endl;
```

This is equivalent to:
```cpp
int max;
if (a > b) {
    max = a;
} else {
    max = b;
}
```

### 📝 Note:
- It's best used when the logic is simple.
- For more complex logic, stick with full `if` statements to keep your code readable.
