Sure! Here's a **simple explanation** of recursion in C++:

---

### 🔁 What is Recursion?

**Recursion** is when a function **calls itself** to solve a smaller version of the same problem.

---

### 🧠 Example: Counting Down

Let's say you want to count down from 5 to 1.

You could write:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void countdown(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return;         // Base case: stop when n is 0
    cout << n << endl;          // Print current number
    countdown(n - 1);           // Call the same function with n-1
}

int main() {
    countdown(5);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 🧾 What happens?

The function calls itself like this:

```
countdown(5)
→ countdown(4)
→ countdown(3)
→ countdown(2)
→ countdown(1)
→ countdown(0) → stops
```

It prints:

```
5
4
3
2
1
```

### 💡 Important Parts:
- **Base case**: when to stop (here it's `if (n == 0)`).
- **Recursive call**: the function calls itself with a smaller number.
