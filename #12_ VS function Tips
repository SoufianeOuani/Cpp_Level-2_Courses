Nice! Here are some super handy **function-related tips** for **Visual Studio (VS)** that will make your C++ (or any language) coding smoother, faster, and smarter:

---

## 💡 TOP FUNCTION TIPS IN VISUAL STUDIO

### 1. 🧭 **View Call Hierarchy**
- **Shortcut:** `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + T` (or right-click → *View Call Hierarchy*)
- 📌 Shows **who calls a function** and **what functions it calls** — super useful for debugging and code exploration.

---

### 2. 🧠 **Go to Definition / Declaration**
- **F12** → Go to definition (function body)
- **Alt + F12** → *Peek definition* (inline view)
- **Ctrl + F12** → Go to declaration (prototype)

---

### 3. 📘 **Parameter Info While Typing**
- When calling a function, VS shows the parameter list:
  ```cpp
  myFunction(|    ← it shows: int a, double b = 0
  ```
- This is great for **default parameters** and overloaded functions.

---

### 4. 🔁 **Function Overload Picker**
- If a function is overloaded, use the **arrow keys** while typing to scroll through overloads.
- VS will show you all available signatures.

---

### 5. 🔍 **Find All References**
- **Shortcut:** `Shift + F12`
- Shows every place the function is used in your project.
- Can be filtered by file, type of usage (read/write), etc.

---

### 6. 🔂 **Code Snippets for Functions**
- Type `fn` then press **Tab Tab** to generate a function snippet:
  ```cpp
  void MyFunction()
  {
      
  }
  ```

You can also customize your own snippets if you write certain patterns often.

---

### 7. 🎯 **Quick Actions (Lightbulb)**
- When you hover over or click a squiggly line, click the lightbulb 💡 to:
  - Generate function declarations/definitions
  - Add missing `#includes`
  - Fix parameter types
  - Rename across project

---

### 8. 🔁 **Toggle Between Header & Source**
- **Ctrl + K, Ctrl + O** → Switch between `.h` and `.cpp` files with the same name.
- Works great when you're declaring functions in headers and defining them in cpp.

---

### 9. ⚙️ **Function Outline**
- Use the **Class View** or **Outline** window to see all functions in your current file.
- Great for navigating large classes or utilities.

---

### 10. 🧪 **Run/Debug Single Function (unit-style)**
If you're testing just one function:
- Right-click inside it → *Run Test* (if it's a test)
- Or set a breakpoint and use **F5** or **F10/F11** to step through just that code

---

### 🧩 Bonus: Extensions That Help
- **ReSharper C++**: Supercharges navigation and refactoring
- **CodeMaid**: For cleaning up unused functions
- **C++ Intellisense Enhancer**: Improves parameter hints
