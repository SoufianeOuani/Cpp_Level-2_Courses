## 🔍 **Debugging in C++: Step Into, Step Over, Step Out**

When you're debugging your C++ code (using tools like **GDB**, **Visual Studio**, **CLion**, etc.), these three commands help you control the flow of execution:

---

### 🔹 1. **Step Into (F11)**

- **What it does:** Enters into the function call on the current line.
- If the current line includes a function call, it takes you **inside** that function to debug it line by line.
- If there's no function call, it just goes to the next line.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
void sayHello() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
}
int main() {
    sayHello(); // Step Into goes inside sayHello()
    return 0;
}
```
If you press **Step Into** on `sayHello();`, the debugger jumps inside the `sayHello()` function.

---

### 🔹 2. **Step Over (F10)**

- **What it does:** Executes the current line completely but **does not go inside** any function calls.
- If the line has a function call, it runs the function and moves to the next line.

**Example:**
```cpp
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
int main() {
    int result = sum(5, 10); // Step Over skips going inside sum()
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Using **Step Over** on `sum(5, 10);` runs the `sum` function and jumps to the next line without stepping into `sum()`.

---

### 🔹 3. **Step Out (Shift + F11)**

- **What it does:** Finishes executing the current function and returns to the caller.
- Useful when you’ve already stepped into a function and want to quickly exit back.

**Example:**
```cpp
void sayHello() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; // Step Out from here goes back to main()
}
int main() {
    sayHello();
    std::cout << "Back in main!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
If you're inside `sayHello()` and press **Step Out**, the debugger will complete the function and jump back to `main()`.

| Command      | Shortcut       | What it Does                          |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Step Into** | `F11`          | Goes **inside** the function call     |
| **Step Over** | `F10`          | Executes line **without entering** functions |
| **Step Out**  | `Shift + F11`  | **Exits** the current function        |
